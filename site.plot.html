    <p> He was only a young boy when the walls protecting the area he is in was broken. Titans poured in the wall and killed all the citizens. He vowed to kill all the titans when his hometown was completely wrecked and his mom eaten. He was forced to flee into the next wall inside with his friends Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlet. When Eren finally came of age, he and his friends started training. Mikasa excelled in training while Eren seemed to be failing. Still, Eren is able to pass training as well as Mikasa and Armin. Eren joins the survey corps because he wants to kill the titans. Mikasa and Armin follow Eren as well as many other trainees because they were motivated by Eren's speech. Soon after the graduation, the colossus titan breaks through the wall once more. The survey corps are sent to kill the titans and protect the citizens.
