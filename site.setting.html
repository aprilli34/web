    <p> Titans are man eating monsters. Regular titans have no inteligence. All titans are bigger and stronger than humans, varying in size. Titans don't need to eat to survive, but still has the desire to eat humans. Tians auto regenerate and their only vulnerable spot is their neck. When they are killed, their corpse evaporates and dissapears into steam. There are abnormal titans which are faster or stronger than the rest. There are also the other nine titans. Those titans are controlled by humans who can transform into a titan when they are injured.

    <p>Humanity relies on ODM gear to kill the titans. ODM gear stands for omni-directional mobility gear. It lets those who use it to fight in midair, granting wonderful mobility. To use them, you aim and fire the grapple hooks on the hand grips to move yourself towards that direction. Gas is used to propell the user forward. There are disposable and replaceable swords attached to the hand grip.</p>

    <p>There are 3 squads where citizens can utilize the ODM gear to protect the people. Citizens are not required to join these squads. The stationary guards maintain and guard the walls. They protect the people inside the walls. The scouting legion ventures outside the wall for titan combat, titan study, human expansion, and outside exploration. They have the strongest soilders. The military police protects the richer people in the inner walls. Before anyone can join any of these squads, they need to undergo training. If they are able to pass training, they are allowed to choose the squad they prefer. Only certain ones can join the military police. There are limited seats for all but the survey corps because there are far too little recruits that join due to the high death rate. </p>
