    <p>His prostitute mother,  Kuchel Ackerman, soon died after his birth. With nobody to take care of him, Levi starved. </p>

    <p>A while later, Kenny Ackeman visited the home to find Kuchel Ackerman dead and Levi malurished. Kenny decided to take Levi in his care and trained him to survive in the slums, including fighting skills. He stayed in the slums until one day Erwin Smith came. Levi and his friends attempted to run away but were captured and joined the Survey Corps with Erwin Smith. Levi's excellent ODM gear let him stand out in the Survey Corps, killing a titan by himself on his first day outside the walls. He seperated from his friends on the journey and sadly they all died. He destroyed the titan who killed his friends but stayed in the survey corps. He rose in position to become the Captain of a squad within the Survery Corps.
