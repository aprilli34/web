    <p>His prostitute mother soon died and Kenny took Levi in and trained him to survive in the slums, including fighting skills. He stayed in the slums until one day Erwin Smith came. Levi and his friends were captured and joined the Survey Corps with Erwin Smith. Levi's excellent ODM gear let him stand out in the Survey Corps, killing a titan by himself on his first day outside the walls. He rose in position to become the Captain of a squad within the Survery Corps.
