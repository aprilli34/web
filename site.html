  <h2>About</h2>
    <p>This website displays a lot of information about Levi Ackerman, explaining how he acts as well as physical characters about himself. There is also information about the universe Levi Ackerman is in. It goes in detail in what the setting of attack on titan is, but never the plot of the actual anime. The display of his brilliance is seen in the sections <a href="site.fights.html">Fights</a> and <a href="site.leviappreciation.html">Levi Appreciation</a> This site contains a lot of spoilers though so browse carefully. </p>

  <h2>Levi Ackerman once said:</h3>

    <p> These are the motivating words that Levi told Erwin when Erwin faltered to lead his soilders to their death. For context, this was when the soilders were surrounded by soilders from all sides and were going to be killed. There were little options. They had to face off against the beast titan who was throwing boulders at them, destroying countless soilders in one move. Erwin decided that him and the soilders were to charge to their deaths to distract the beast tian so Levi could kill it. However, Erwin was struggling because he wanted to visit the Eren's basement. Levi knew what to say to motivate Levi to actually continue with the plan. He knew that Erwin would regret it if he didn't carry out the plan.
