  <h2>Characteristics</h2>
    <p> Levi Ackerman is super strong. He is very blunt and cold, making him hard to approach. He rarely shows his emotions. His sense of humor tends toward the vulgar, insulting, and dark. Still, he has a strong sense of morality and empathy. As he is a member of the survery corps, troops constantly die and he cares for his subordinates. Even when Levi knows he is humanities strongest soilder, his skills far beyond everyone around him, he doesn't brag about his skills. He can think very level headed in very difficult situations. Even when his friends died, he could recover quickly and still survive. SPOILERS: He commanded for Erwin, his closest friend, to charge him and the soilders to their death because he knew that it was the only solution for them to possibly kill the titan they were facing. When he is given the chance to save Erwin from certain death, he decides to not do it. His emotions doesn't take control of him. He calmy evaluates the situation before him and chooses the best possible option.    
      He is very short, only 160 cm.

    <p>A while later, Kenny Ackeman visited the home to find Kuchel Ackerman dead and Levi malurished. Kenny decided to take Levi in his care and trained him to survive in the slums, including fighting skills. He stayed in the slums until one day Erwin Smith came. Levi and his friends attempted to run away but were captured and joined the Survey Corps with Erwin Smith. Levi's excellent ODM gear let him stand out in the Survey Corps, killing a titan by himself on his first day outside the walls. He seperated from his friends on the journey and sadly they all died. He destroyed the titan who killed his friends but stayed in the survey corps. He rose in position to become the Captain of a squad within the Survery Corps.
