  <h2>About Levi Ackerman</h2>
    <p> Levi Ackerman is super strong. He is very blunt and cold, making him hard to approach. He rarely shows his emotions. His sense of humor tends toward the vulgar, insulting, and dark. Still, he has a strong sense of morality and empathy. As he is a member of the survery corps, troops constantly die and he cares for his subordinates. Even when Levi knows he is humanities strongest soilder, his skills far beyond everyone around him, he doesn't brag about his skills. He can think very level headed in very difficult situations. Even when his friends died, he could recover quickly and still survive. SPOILERS: He commanded for Erwin, his closest friend, to charge him and the soilders to their death because he knew that it was the only solution for them to possibly kill the titan they were facing. When he is given the chance to save Erwin from certain death, he decides to not do it. His emotions doesn't take control of him. He calmy evaluates the situation before him and chooses the best possible option.    
      He is very short, only 160 cm.
