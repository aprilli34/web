    <p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjiCS5Zj1hM">Levi vs Beast Titan </a></p>   
    <p> The survey corps took an outing, trying to make some big changes. They try to capture/kill 3 of the nine titan shifters. They think they have it all under control, until they realize that the titans were inside the walls surroudning them. Normal titans surrounded them all with no hope in sight. Almost everyone died and the rest of the troops tried the last struggle. Levi, Erwin, and the trainees were to handle the beast titan, one of the 9 titan shifters. They needed to distract all the titans as Levi slowly approached the beast titan. The only tactic Levi came up with Erwin was for them all to charge to their death towards the titans as Levi approached. Erwin had to take command so the troops could be motivated. Erwin hesitated, wanting to make a selfish decision for the first time. However, Levi commanded Erwin to charge to his death, knowing Erwin would drown in guilt if he did not. After all the troops were killed, Levi had already apporached the beat titan to kill them. The details of the fight can be obsorved in the video.

    <p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNWd6Jyi5ZA">Erwin Last Moment</a></p>
    <p> When Erwin charged at the beast titan, Erwin never died, but he was at the verge of death. Levi had to choose between Armin of Erwin to save by giving the titan formula. The titan formula would turn the one it was used on into a titan shifter, which means they would be auto regenerated. Levi contemplates who to save, but after careful thought and removal of personal emotions, he chooses to save Armin. This shows Levi as Erwin draws his last breath.
